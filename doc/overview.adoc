= Overview

== Basic concept

This runtime is designed for accelerator side applications.
Here is an example usecase of host and accelerator.

[plantuml]
----
@startuml
participant "Host" as Host
participant "Accelerator" as Acc

activate Host

Host -> Acc : App + Runtime
Host -> Acc : Put input data/parameters
Host -> Acc : Run accelerator
activate Acc
deactivate Host

Acc -> Acc : Do heavy task

Acc -> Host : Notify finished
activate Host
deactivate Acc
Host -> Acc : Get output data/results

== Goals

* Easy to use
  ** Fully support POSIX APIs by C library for Linux
  ** Reuse almost build environment for Linux
* Lightweigt
  ** Implement minimum features for smaller footprint than Linux
  ** Limit maximum number of threads up to physical cores to remove the thread scheduler (and it's overhead) from runtime
* Single task
  ** Concentrate to run the heavy calculation task
  ** Accept to drop some typical OS features (I/O, signals, ...)
